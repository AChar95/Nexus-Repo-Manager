# Repository Manager Guide

## 1. Introduction

This repository was developed to be a guide to help set up the various repository managers. It is designed to be a reference tool as I found it overwhelming as a new comer to set up the basics for the repository. I have tried my best to keep this guide as simple as possible, and have divided each repository in installation/set methods which I have used


## 2. Overview

The **nexus3** is the set up guide for the OSS distribution of the Sonartype Nexus manager. This, at the time of writing, is freely available to anyone, the only caviat is that its images are stored on your own machine rather than that of a cloud server (this is in terms of machines which you either own or have access to, it can be deployed as a cloud solution)
